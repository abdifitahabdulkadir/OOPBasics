Interface is the service requiremnt specification (SRC);

it providesthe defiantion of all required specifications
but the implementationsi about you.

for exmample 

Services APi (delvelped by sun macrosystem)

then there are gorup of webservers that allows java 
JSB programs to run all fo them even for same program
because all of them they have implemented the
same API 
1. tomact
2. OSh
3. Weblogic
4. Resin.



2... second defiantion : interface is any contract between  client and servicce provider.
exmample :

the client wants colledge automation system

then manager provides simple interface looks like 
 { 
  1. map1()
  2. map2()
  3. ma3()
  4. map4()
  5. map5()
 }

 those are interace / visible requirements will provode by system to the client and not yet implemented.
