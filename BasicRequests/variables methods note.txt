=====variables

there are three vaiabls 
1. instnace variables ==> variabls outsdide of method and belong to the object and initialize when every object of that class is created .
and every time object is created again it again 
creates the that object and every object has copy of of that variabls.

-> scope is only withiin class using instace of the calss.



1. local variables --> variables declare inside the method and thier scope is unitl or insdie the method 
and initialized when method is created.

2. Static variables --> variables similar to instace variable with defination syntax static keyword and they belong to the class.

-- it is initialize when execution starts not when object is created because they belong to class not object.

-- think that like that static methods and varibales are memroy always
beause when calss is called and create obejct we are again using some blueprint 
and design to create another entity-- object so we class we load ontime to memroyand will be that and we an use that like kind of architecture to create any entity has these properties and behaviors.

sot hat is why we have some value of static variable and static method because 
they belong to calss and initialize when class is load
if we create mmultibe times obejct from that class.

N:B==> no matter how many objects we create only one object of static method and vaiable is avaliable all of the obejcts 
while instance and local vaiable always different every time we create different object.

== =================Static methods
are methods used to call the static varaibles and as the names
sugges whenver the value is changing based speicic entity we create from that obejct then we dont need to use static method and varaible but when all the
entity have common value we can use them to put in static method or variable.

=== Constructors==> are speical type of methods belgon to the class
-- unlike the methods it does not have returntype, static , final and abstract keyword before it.

-- default Constructor is called if you dont mention any Constructor
-- parametrized Constructor -- Constructor wiht some arguments.
--non-parametrized Constructor --> Constructor without arguments.

usage=> to initialize variables inthe run time.
