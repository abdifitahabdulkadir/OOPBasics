Association ==> Has a relationship 
-- establishing relationship between two classes througth thier objects.

There are two types Association:

1.... Aggregation -> is type of association where both entites that are associated can exists independtly.

-- they relate kind of has- relationship

-- {Colledge has Teacher}
-- {Office has Employe}

exmaple 
here Colledge does not contain or compose teacher but i has 
belong so means when we are building colledge does not contin teachers so they can exists independtly.
here container and contained can survive independtly 
teacher can be exists breaking of colledge and vice verse.

contianer is whole(college) and contained is the part {teacher}
1. Colledge has teacher why Aggregation?
because 
Colledge can exists independtly seperate from that teacher.
Teacher can exists and be a teacher in another college.



2... Composition
simply compostion is has relationship but composed or contianed
can not survive it's own (kickten).
contianer is whole(House) and contained is the part {Kitcken}
- compositon means two entites area associted but with strong realtionship between them so like House and kicken so when 
house is ther and kicken is there is yes but when whole -- contianed one (house ) is killed then part(kicken) is not make sense alone.
--It composes means to create House class you you need kicken  and you use kicken as house contains /composes the kitcken.
