access modifiers as the name sugges are keywords in java or programming lanauges that speicfies and descripes how far we can access the the spefic varaibel, method, or any calsss.

public ==> every thing that is public is accessible within package it is defined, outside of package (by importing tha pakcage);

1. for calss scenario-> if the calssi public then we can create instance of that calss in anywhere java appliation by importing it and aacces all its members if they are public.


2. default => this is the when we dont mention any tupe of modifer.
- for example if we create another class and 
or make [company] class default (remove public) then it raises compilation error.

-->default we can acess only within package and nested pakcages of that package --was defined it at most.


3. Private --> simply either variable or method or inner calss private accessible only withiin the class it is defined.


4. Protected -> it is only accessible within pakcage and subclasess of class it was defined inside it.
